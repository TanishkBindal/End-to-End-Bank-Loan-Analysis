# End to End Bank Loan Portfolio Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a bank’s loan portfolio using Power BI. The objective was to evaluate loan performance, monitor credit risk exposure, analyze borrower behavior, and generate data-driven insights to support strategic financial decision-making.
The solution consists of three interactive dashboard pages:

Summary Dashboard- Portfolio health & KPI overview

Overview Dashboard- Trend & segmentation analysis

Details Dashboard- Transaction-level loan insights

The report transforms raw loan data into structured, executive-level insights for performance monitoring and risk assessment.

## Problem Statement

### Dashboard 1: Summary

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

1. **Total Loan Applications :** Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
2. **Total Funded Amount :** Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, monitor MTD Total Funded Amount and analyze  Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
3. **Total Amount Received :** Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment, including MTD Total Amount Received and MoM changes.
4. **Average Interest Rate :** Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitor MoM variations in interest rates.
5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) :** Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD and track MoM fluctuations.

#### Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s:
#### Good Loan:                                                                    
1. Good Loan Application Percentage                                                  
2. Good Loan Applications
3. Good Loan Funded Amount
4. Good Loan Total Received Amount

  #### Bad Loan:
1. Bad Loan Application Percentage                                                  
2. Bad Loan Applications
3. Bad Loan Funded Amount
4. Bad Loan Total Received Amount


#### Loan Status Grid View
Gain a comprehensive overview of lending operations and monitor loan performance categorized by 'Loan Status'. This grid view provides insights into metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded Amount, MTD Amount Received, Average Interest Rate and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).

### Dashboard 2: Overview
### Charts

1. **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Area Chart) :** Identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
2. **Regional Analysis by State (Azure Map) :** Identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.
3. **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart) :** Understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4. **Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart) :** Assess how lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths.
5. **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart) :** Provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans.
6. **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map) :** View how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements hierarchically.


### Dashboard 3: Details
Provides a comprehensive view of key loan-related metrics and data points, facilitating efficient access to critical information about loan portfolio, borrower profiles and loan performance.
