# End to End Bank Loan Portfolio Analysis

## 🔎 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a bank’s loan portfolio using Power BI. The objective was to evaluate loan performance, monitor credit risk exposure, analyze borrower behavior, and generate data-driven insights to support strategic financial decision-making.
The solution consists of three interactive dashboard pages:

Summary Dashboard- Portfolio health & KPI overview

Overview Dashboard- Trend & segmentation analysis

Details Dashboard- Transaction-level loan insights

The report transforms raw loan data into structured, executive-level insights for performance monitoring and risk assessment.
